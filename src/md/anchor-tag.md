prefLabel: Octothorpes Are Anchors
---

If you want a link to be an octothorpe in the content of your page rather than just metadata, you can use an `<a>` tag.

```
<a 
  rel="octo:octothorpes" 
  href="<ring>/~/architecture">
  Architecture
</a>
```

`rel=`: Defines the `link` as an Octothorpe.

`href=`: References a Tag on an Octothorpes Ring as well as a URL on your website.

This `<a>` will tag the page with the octothorpe [#architecture](/~/architecture).
