# Hashtags for the Internet

Octothorpes are [hashtags](/~) and [backlinks](/>) that can be used anywhere on the web, linking urls and resources across a network of [domains](/domains).

## How To Octothorpe

1. [Register](/docs/register-a-domain) with an Octothorpes Ring
2. [Create Hashtags](/docs/link-tag) on your site.
3. [Create Backlinks](/docs/creating-backlinks) to other sites.

## Why Tho

Octothorpes frees the fun and utility of hashtags from the confines of commercial platforms and individual domains.

Octothorpe servers expand on web rings and blog rolls, acting as feeds and search engines that small communities can easily own and manage.

## Create your own Ring

Anyone can [host their own Octothorpes](/hosting-a-community) Ring either through the [open-source codebase](https://github.com/stucco-software/octothorp.es) or [hosted via IS/SS.](/hosted-ring)
