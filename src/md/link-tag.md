# Octothorpes Are Links

Specifically, octothorpes are links between your page a Ringâ€™s tag. Create them by adding a `<link>` tag to your pages `<head>`.

```
<link 
  rel="octo:octothorpes"
  href="architecture" >
```

`rel=`: Defines the `link` as an Octothorpe.

`href=`: References a Tag on an Octothorpes Ring.

This `<link>` will tag the page with the octothorpe [#architecture](/~/architecture).
